### Analysis of Opinions on Same-Sex Relations

Ariana Olson, Emma Price

Public opinion regarding same-sex relations has changed dramatically in recent years. What was in recent memory something that most people considered to be "always wrong" is now considered by most people to be "never wrong." This raises the question of how public opinion has changed. Have younger people, who did not experience the AIDs crisis and have experienced a very different type of popular culture swayed general public opinion? Has everyone become less disapproving of same-sex relations overtime? Are people more accepting when they are young, and become less so as they age? Also, how do demographics like sex, income, location, and religion effect this change in public opinion? We find that the public opinion of same-sex relations has changed primarily as an effect of birth year and period; people who were born more recently are more accepting and everyone has become more accepting over time. We found that a number of demographics effect the likelihood that someone is accepting of same-sex relations, particularly religion -- both what religion a person practices and how serious their practice is. Ultimately, though this analysis is interesting and helps us unpack this complex social-religios-political issue, these results should not be used to pass judgment on others.
