# Age-Period-Cohort Analysis of Opinions on LGBT issues
### Ariana Olson, Emma Price


We are using GSS data from which we selected 45 variables regarding public opion on different LGBT-related topics, other politically driven opinions (e.g. does the government spend too much on education), and various demographics that might drive those opinions. Some of this demographic data includes religion, strength of religious affiliation, political party, work status, region of interview, and dozens more. We are planning to complete an age-period-cohort analysis of this data to investigate public opinion on LGBT issues. LGBT-related topics, especially public opinion of LGBT issues, have changed rapidly in recent years. We are interested in investigating the drivers of this rapid change and how this change has differed across age, period, and various cohorts.

We have a cleaned set of this data from the GSS website out of NORC at the University of Chicago. There are definitely ethical considerations to make when dealing with what has often been a fairly contested topic in the US. As well, we need to be considerate when making our cohorts to avoid being insensitive to different demographics of people.
